- micro-dsl for creating git repositories for testing

- port github-fake to Python, so we can test in fbcode
- Note: must use graphql-core-next, because GitHub GraphQL schema
  uses new features not understood by graphql-core (namely '&' schema;
  this is true even as of 2.1)

- maybe we should force push when structure changes?
