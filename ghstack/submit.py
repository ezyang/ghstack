        # There are two distinct usage patterns:
        #
        #   1. You may want to submit only HEAD, but not everything below it,
        #      because you only did minor changes to the commits below and
        #      you want to let the CI finish without those changes.
        #      See https://github.com/ezyang/ghstack/issues/165
        #
        #   2. I want to submit a prefix of the stack, because I'm still working
        #      on the top of the stack and don't want to spam people with
        #      useless changes.  See https://github.com/ezyang/ghstack/issues/101
        #
        # If we use standard git log/rev-list style parsing, you get (2) by
        # default because a single commit implies a reachability constraint.
        # Specifying (1) is a bit inconvenient; you have to say something
        # like `ghstack submit HEAD~..`.  In particular, both (1) and (2) would like
        # the meaning of `ghstack submit HEAD` to do different things (1 wants a single
        # commit, whereas 2 wants everything reachable from the commit.)
        #
        # To resolve the ambiguity, we introduce a new command line argument
        # --no-stack (analogous to the --stack argument on jf) which disables
        # "stacky" behavior.  With --no-stack, we only submit HEAD by default
        # and you can also specify a specific commit to submit if you like
        # (if this commit is not reachable from HEAD, we will tell you how
        # to checkout the updated commit.)  If you specify multiple commits,
        # we will process each of them in turn.  Ranges are not supported; use
        # git rev-list to preprocess them into single commits first (in principle
        # we could support this, but it would require determining if a REV was
        # a range versus a commit, as different handling would be necessary
        # in each case.)
        #
        # Without --no-stack, we use standard git rev-list semantics.  Some of the
        # more advanced spellings can be counterintuitive, but `ghstack submit X`
        # is equivalent to checking out X and then performing ghstack (and then
        # restacking HEAD on top, if necessary), and you can say `X..Y`
        # (exclusive-inclusive) to specify a specific range of commits (oddly,
        # `X..` will do what you expect, but `..Y` will almost always be empty.)
        # But I expect this to be fairly niche.
        #
        # In both cases, we support submitting multiple commits, because the set
        # of commits you specify affects what rebasing we do, which is sometimes
        # not conveniently done by calling ghstack multiple times.

        # --no-stack

        # have a directly analogous concept, so we need some other strategy.  A
        # simple approach is to inspect the base branch in the upstream
        # repository, and exclude all commits which are reachable from it.
        # We don't want to blast ALL remote branches into the list here though;
        # it's possible the draft commits were pushed to the remote repo for
        # unrelated reasons, and we don't want to treat them as non-draft if

        #   - Remote base branch
        #   - Remote head branch
        #
        # Our job is to synchronize local with remote.  Here are a few
        # common situations:
        #
        #   - Neither this commit nor any of the earlier commits were
        #     modified; everything is in sync.  We want to do nothing in this
        #     case.
        #
        #   - User updated top commit on stack, but none of the earlier commits.
        #     Here, we expect local parent tree to match remote base tree (BA), but
        #     local commit tree to mismatch remote head branch (A).  We will push
        #     a new commit to head (A2), no merge necessary.
        #
        #       BA
        #        \
        #         A - A2
        #
        #   - User updated an earlier commit in the stack (it doesn't matter
        #     if the top commit is logically modified or not: it always counts as
        #     having been modified to resolve the merge.)  We don't expect
        #     local parent tree to match remote base tree, so we must push a
        #     new base commit (BA2), and a merge commit (A2) on it.
        #
        #       BA - BA2
        #        \    \
        #         A - A2
        #
        #     Notably, this must happen even if the local commit tree matches
        #     the remote head branch.  A common situation this could occur is
        #     if we squash commits I and J into IJ (keeping J as the tree).
        #     Then for J we see:
        #
        #        BJ - BJ2
        #         \    \
        #          J - BJ2
        #
        #    Where BJ contains I, but BJ2 does NOT contain I.  The net result
        #    is the changes of I are included inside the BJ2 merge commit.
        #
        # First time submission proceeds similarly, except that we no longer
        # need to create a parent pointer to the previous base/head.
        #
        # Note that, counterintuitively, the base of a diff has no
        # relationship to the head of an earlier diff on the stack.  This
        # makes it possible to selectively only update one diff in a stack
        # without updating any others.  This also makes our handling uniform
        # even if you rebase a commit backwards: you just see that the base
        # is updated to also remove changes.

            #    \   \
            #     M2  M1  # M1 was cherry-picked onto A, becoming M2

            #   A - B - C

            #       \-----/
            #
            # However, the merge base for C and M2 will always be computed to
            # be B, because B is an ancestor of both C and M2, and it always
            # beets out A (which is an ancestor of B).  This means that you
            # will diff M2 against B, which will typically result in "remove
            # changes from B" spuriously showing up on the PR.
            #
            # When heads are always monotonically moving forward in time,
            # there is not any problem with progressively more complicated
            # merge histories, because we always specify the "correct" base
            # branch.  For example, consider:
            #
            #   A - B
            #        \
            #         \- X - Y1
            #          \
            #           \- Y2
            #
            # Where Y1 is cherry-picked off of X onto B directly.  In branch
            # form, this becomes:
            #
            #   A - B
            #        \
            #         \- X - Y1 - Y2
            #
            # But we update the base branch to be B, so we correctly diff Y2
            # against B (where here, the tree for Y2 no longer incorporates
            # the changes for X).
            #
            # What does NOT work in this situation is if you manually (outside
            # of ghstack) retarget Y2 back at X; we will spuriously report
            # that the diff X and Y2 removes the changes from X.  If you use
            # ghstack, however, we will do this:
            #
            #   A - B
            #        \
            #         \- X - Y1 - Y2 - Y3
            #
            # Where here Y3 has restored the changes from X, so the diff from
            # X to Y3 checks out.
            #
            # It turns out there are a subset of manipulations, for which it
            # is always safe to change the target base commit from GitHub UI
            # without pushing a new commit.  Intuitively, the idea is that
            # once you add a commit as a merge base, you can't take it back:
            # we always consider that branch to have been "merged in".  So
            # you can effectively only ever insert new commits between
            # pre-existing commits, but once a commit depends on another
            # commit, that dependency must always exist.  I'm still
            # considering whether or not we should force push by default in
            # this sort of situation.
            #
