"""This module determines if the commits need to be signed.
We need to do this manually, because ghstack uses commit-tree instead of commit.
commit-tree command doesn't pick up commit.gpgsign git config

The porcelain git behavior w.r.t. signing is

when both `commit.gpgsign` and `user.signingkey` are set, the commit is signed
when only `commit.gpgsign` is true, git errors out

This module will retain this behavior:
We will attempt to sign as long as `commit.gpgsign` is true.
If not key is configure, error will occur
